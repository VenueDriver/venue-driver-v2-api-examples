# Venue Driver v2 API examples

Sample Ruby code that demonstrates how to call the Venue Driver v2 API.

## Running

### Step 1: (Optional) Install RVM

https://rvm.io/rvm/install

You might like to run Ruby in some other way.  Have fun with that.

### Step 2: Install Ruby

I used 2.4 and that's recorded in the .rvmrc file.  Any 2.x version will probably work.  (Older versions might require a Gemfile adjustment to use an older version of HTTParty.)

### Step 3: Install Bundler

    gem install bundler

### Step 4: Install gem bundle

    bundle install

### Step 5: Run a simple example
